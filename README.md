## Model Details and Visualization

### 1. Probabilistic Model

#### Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
- GMM is a statistical model expressing a dataset as a mix of Gaussian distributions.
- Used for tasks like clustering and density estimation.

#### Naive Bayes Classifier Model
- A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem, efficient for text classification and spam filtering.

#### Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
- Statistical models representing a system with hidden states, widely used in speech recognition and natural language processing.

*Visualizations, loss curves, and classification reports are provided for each model.*

**Statistics:**
- Naive Bayes exhibited significantly higher accuracy compared to GMM and HMM.

### 2. Unsupervised Model

#### K-Means Clustering Model
- A partitioning algorithm grouping data points based on feature similarities to minimize within-cluster variance.

#### DB-SCAN Model
- Density-based clustering algorithm identifying clusters as dense regions separated by sparser areas.

#### Hierarchical Clustering
- Agglomerative or divisive approach organizing data into a tree-like hierarchy of clusters.

*Visualizations, loss curves, and comparisons are provided for each model.*

**Statistics:**
- K-Means showed significantly higher Silhouette Score compared to DBSCAN and Hierarchical Clustering.

### 3. Dimensionality Reduction

#### PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Technique transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving variance.

#### t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) Model
- Dimensionality reduction technique visualizing high-dimensional data by preserving local similarities.

*Visualizations, loss curves, and comparisons are provided for each model.*

**Statistics:**
- PCA exhibited significantly higher accuracy compared to t-SNE.

### 4. Ensemble Model

#### Random Forest
- Ensemble learning method constructing decision trees during training for robust and accurate predictions.

#### Gradient Boosting Model
- Ensemble learning technique combining weak predictive models sequentially to create a strong predictive model.

*Visualizations, loss curves, and classification reports are provided for each model.*

**Statistics:**
- XGB Boosting exhibited significantly higher accuracy compared to Random Forest.

## Conclusion

After a comprehensive review and comparison, we conclude that for our IDS dataset, XGB Boosting is the perfect ensemble model, offering high accuracy compared to other models.
